Time Integrations Solvers

Shows how to use different kind of time integration solvers on simple ODE :
dy/dt = f(y(t),t)
where f is unknown
Example includes : 
-Euler explicit
-Explicit Runge Kutta 2nd and 4th order
Implicit schemes are not available because it would required to assume f is inversible (or linear)


Dependencies: 
 matplotlib.pyplot as plt (for plotting)
